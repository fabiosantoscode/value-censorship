# value-censorship

This is a way to run untrusted code by censoring every value that's ever called or passed to a function call. It also prevents from using catch statements (try...finally is still allowed). If your untrusted code can't call unsafe functions, there's not much it can do. Uses [VM2](https://npmjs.com/vm2) internally.

Since it censors practically every possibility of breaking out of the VM, it's an effective way to secure unsafe code especially since it runs under VM2.

## Example

```js
const censor = require('value-censorship')

// Then in an async function of your choice...
await censor(`
  global["eva" + "l"]("42")  // Throws CensorStop error
  global["Functio" + "n"]("42")  // Throws CensorStop error
  new (function(){}.constructor)("42")  // Throws CensorStop error
`)

await censor(legitCode, { giveThisFunctionToTheCode: () => null })
```
